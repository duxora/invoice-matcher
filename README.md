# claude-scheduler

Scheduled AI tasks for Claude Code. A self-healing periodic task runner built for Claude Code power users who want to automate recurring development workflows.

Define tasks as `.task` files, schedule them with cron-like syntax, and let Claude Code execute them autonomously -- with retry logic, failure investigation, and remediation agents built in.

## Install

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.10+, [Claude CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed and authenticated.

```
pip install claude-scheduler
```

## Quickstart

```bash
cs init                          # Initialize config and task directory
cs new                           # Create a new task (interactive)
cs run my-task.task --dry-run    # Preview without executing
cs serve                         # Start the scheduler daemon
```

## Task File Format

Tasks are plain text files with a comment header and a prompt body, separated by `---`.

```
# name: Daily Dependency Audit
# schedule: daily 09:00
# workdir: ~/workspace/myproject
# tools: Read,Grep,Glob
# max_turns: 5
# model: claude-sonnet-4-6
# timeout: 300
# enabled: true
---
Check all dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
Report findings grouped by severity.
```

## Web Dashboard

Start the web UI (part of the tools-hub server):

```
cs serve
```

Available at `http://localhost:7070/scheduler/`. Features:

- Task overview with status, schedule, and health indicators
- Run history with duration and cost tracking
- AI-assisted prompt generation and improvement
- Create and edit tasks from the browser
- Enable/disable tasks with one click
- Error log viewer and remediation ticket management
- System health checks (doctor)
- Approval workflow for proposed changes

## Configuration

Configuration lives at `~/.config/claude-scheduler/config.toml`.

```toml
[server]
host = "127.0.0.1"
port = 7070

[paths]
tasks = "~/workspace/tools/claude-scheduler/tasks"
logs = "~/workspace/tools/claude-scheduler/logs"
data = "~/workspace/tools/claude-scheduler/data"

[defaults]
model = "claude-sonnet-4-6"
max_turns = 10
timeout = 300
tools = "Read,Grep,Glob"
notify = "errors"
on_failure = "notify"
```

## Auto-Start

Register the scheduler as a system service so it starts on login:

**macOS (launchd):**

```bash
cs serve --install      # Creates ~/Library/LaunchAgents plist
cs serve --uninstall    # Removes the plist and unloads the agent
```

**Linux (systemd):**

```bash
cs serve --install      # Creates ~/.config/systemd/user/ unit file
cs serve --uninstall    # Disables and removes the unit
```

## Remediation Flow

When a task fails with `on_failure: investigate`, the scheduler:

1. Records the error and the Claude session ID
2. Resumes the failed session with `claude -p --resume <session_id>`, giving the remediation agent full context of everything the task did
3. If the agent fixes the issue, the task is re-run automatically
4. If the agent needs human input, a ticket is created -- resolve it with `cs remediate <id> --guidance "try X"`

Each step preserves the full conversation context from prior sessions.
